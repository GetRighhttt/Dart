/**
 * Null in programming is basically when the variable doesn't have a reference
 * in memory, and/or doesn't hold anytihng.
 *
 * "The million dollar mistake".
 *
 * Historically, returning a null value causes a lot of errors, and most older
 * programming languages did not have nullable - able to be null data types
 * available.
 *
 * Now, we see in kotlin, swift, and other languages that we can declare a
 * variable to be nullable, and dart has recently adopted this approach to
 * help avoid massive errors and apps crashing.
