The Pub Package System allows us to add dependenciesto your project and make your life easier by utitlizing other
people's code.

There are two types of dependencies in which you are probably going to add to your projects at some point
in time when working with Dart.
dev_dependencies, and regular dependencies.

dependencies are packaged into your application. They are built for publishing.

dev_dependencies are not packaged into your application. They are there essentially to make the developers life a little
bit easier when they are developing code.
